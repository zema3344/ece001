<h1>Internet of Things</h1>
<p>internt of things Is a collection of interrelated computing devices , mechanical and digital machines , objects , animals or individuals that have uniqueidentifiers (UIDs) and the ability to transmit data over a network without needing human-to - human or computer-to - computer interaction.</p>

<p>in this site we will talk briefly about IoT</p>
<hr>
<p>There are several emerging IoT standards, including the following:</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
    <li>The Internet Engineering Task Force ( IETF) defines IPv6 overLow-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) as an open standard.The 6LoWPAN protocol enables connectivity to the Internet through any low-powertransmitter, like 804.15.4, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Z-Wave (for home automation).</li>
    <li>ZigBee is a low-power , low-data wirelessnetwork which is primarily used in industrial environments.ZigBee is based on specification 802.15.4 ofthe Institution of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).The ZigBee Alliance has developed Dotdot, the standardized IoT language that enablessmart devices to function and understand each other safely on any network.</li>
    <li>LiteOS is a Unix-like operating system (OS) for wireless sensor networks. LiteOS supports smartphones, wearables, intelligent manufacturing applications, smart homes and the internet of vehicles (IoV). The OS also serves as a smart device development platform.<br><br></li>

<p><strong>How IoT Works:</strong></p>
<p>An IoT ecosystem consists of web-enabled smart devices that use embedded systems, such as processors,sensors and communication hardware, to capture, transmit and act on data they acquire from their environment.IoT devices share the sensor data they are collecting by connecting to an IoT gateway orother edge device where data is either sent to the cloud for analysis or analyzation locally.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
Such systems often interact with other similar devices, and
operate on the input they obtain from each other.
Most of the work is done without human intervention by the devices, although people can interact
with the devices — for example, set them up, give them instructions or access the data. </p>
